Bank account


A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make deposits and
withdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops can charge against the
account.
It should be possible to close an account; operations against a closed account must
fail.
Copy the bank account folder to your solution repository, in there, there is
account.js which contains the BankAccount class with skeleton methods. Implement
the skeleton methods to the best of your imagination. Also add some tests
account.test.js
